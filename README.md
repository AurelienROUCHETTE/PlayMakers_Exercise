We want users to upload a badge: an avatar within a circle.  
Create a function taking a png as input and verifying that:

* Size = 512x512 📏🖼️  ✅✅
* The only non transparent pixels are within a circle 🟥⭕  ✅✅
* The colors in the badge give a "happy" feeling 🎨😊 ✅

Additionally, you can create a parallel function that converts the given image (of any format) into the specified object.
