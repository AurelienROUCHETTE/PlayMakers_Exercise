We want users to upload a badge: an avatar within a circle. Create a function taking a png as input and verifying that:

* Size = 512x512 ✅
* The only non transparent pixels are within a circle
* The colors is the badge give a "happy" feeling 

Additionally, you can create a parallel function that converts the given image (of any format) into the specified object.
